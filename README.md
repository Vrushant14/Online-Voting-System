# Online-Voting-System
A C++ Project on Online Voting System, using OOPS concepts like Inheritance and Polyorphism.

Problem Statement:

Online Voting System:
Creating an online voting system that combines security and accessibility, while
ensuring legal requirements.


Explanation:
The code outlines an online voting system, where it consists of two key user roles:
admins and voters. Admins are granted control over tasks like managing candidates,
initializing elections, tracking scores, and announcing results. Meanwhile, voters are
able to view the participating candidates, place their votes, and review their own
voter details. The system includes some basic security features, such as ensuring
voters are at least 18 years old and confirming administrators via an ID and pin. It
keeps a tally of votes for each candidate and prevents voters from casting multiple
ballots. The system hence, effectively determines the election winner by counting the
votes for each candidate and declaring the candidate with the highest number of
votes as the overall winner.
